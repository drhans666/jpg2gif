# jpg2gif<br />
Demo at: http://jpg2gif.vipserv.org/<br />
By now i think whole app is written VERY poorly(especially models usage). Dont do it this way<br />
Suprisingly it works well <br />
Django project that contains two functionalities:<br />

1)'Jpg2gif' helps with converting single or multiple jpg images into gif animation.<br />
Let's user:<br />
-browse for files<br />
-set name<br />
-set color/b&w mode<br />
-set gif size (automatically rescales with width size)<br />
-set speed of animation (time period between frames)<br />
<br />
2)'Decrease image size' helps with converting image to certain filesize. For example if Your image is to large for some internet<br />
apps (sending pictures with email, forum avatars, etc.)<br />
Let's user:<br />
-browse for file<br />
-set name<br />
-set filesize limit<br />

All app files commented to provide basic idea how it works.<br />
All module requirements in requirements.txt<br />
